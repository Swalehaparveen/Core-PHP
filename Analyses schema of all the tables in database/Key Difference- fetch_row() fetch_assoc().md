**Key Differences:**

1. **fetch_row()** returns a numerically indexed array, while **fetch_assoc()** returns an associative array with column names as keys.

2. With **fetch_row()**, you access column values using numerical indices **(like $row[0], $row[1])**, while **fetch_assoc()** allows accessing values by their column names **(like $row['id'], $row['name'])**.

3. **fetch_row()** is more suited when you need to iterate through a result set and handle columns based on their position, whereas **fetch_assoc()** is convenient when you want to access columns by their names for better readability and understanding of the data being fetched.
